                    <p>All Souls Day. The right day to visit the graves of our beloved departure.(Not on All Saints day. I think.)</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned, there should be no classes today. But there are no announcements so I went to school.</p>

                    <p>First subject is a laboratory class. The internet is down so we could not work on our projects. The day just went by with me looking like this-_-.</p>

                    <p>All Saints Day came and  I have no plan for the day. I washed my clothes and as I finish my father arrived from somewhere I don't know about.</p>

                    <p>I finished my laundry and laid down for a moment to try to get a little rest. Then I was disturb by a starting engine. I went to check it out. I saw my father starting the car then asked, "I'm going to km4 wanna come?" he said. I nodded then took a quick shower and changed.</p>

                    <p>We went to km4 and the roads were pretty much free. No traffic at all, all the shops are closed and there are only few peoples around.</p>

                    <p>Then we arrived. For me it was pretty much a reunion with people I have'nt seen for almost a year. Kids grew, Aunts still beautiful as always and uncles having a time of their lives drinking and laughing.</p>
